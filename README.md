# 🤖 GenAI & LLMs: Architecture and Data Preparation 🚀

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a **comprehensive hands-on guide and experimentation ground** for Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). Based on the curriculum from the IBM course, this project focuses on understanding underlying architectures and the critical data preparation phase required for modern AI engineering.

This project aims to:
* **Explore Generative Architectures:** Implement and differentiate between various models like RNNs, Transformers, GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion models.
* **Master Data Preparation:** Demonstrate professional-grade tokenization and data pipeline construction.
* **Practical LLM Implementation:** Bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge of models (like GPT and BERT) and practical, runnable code examples.
* **Build Efficient Pipelines:** Utilize PyTorch data loaders to prepare high-quality datasets for model training.
